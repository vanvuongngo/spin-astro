# Spin Astro Starter

This is a simple [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/) starter web app that runs (and deploys) as a WebAssembly app using [Spin](https://spinframework.dev/).


## Build

```
pnpm build
```

Re-compiles the Astro site to the `/dist` directory. This directory can be [modified](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/configuration-reference/#base) in the Astro config.mjs file.


## Dev

```

```

This runs Astro via Spin.
